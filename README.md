# Socket.io_Implementation

In Socket.IO, a connection refers to the establishment of a persistent, real-time communication channel between the client and the server. This connection allows the two parties to send and receive messages or events in real time.

On the Server-Side: The server listens for incoming connections and establishes a channel with each connected client.
On the Client-Side: The client initiates the connection with the server and maintains the communication channel.
